    <h1>Cybersecurity Risks of .zip Domain Zone</h1> <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIG.su_rVACPEBk9nGdrn19.?pid=ImgGn" alt=".zip logo" class="logo">
    <p>Google recently unveiled eight new top-level domains (TLDs) designed to inspire fathers (.dad), graduates (.prof,
        .phd, and .esq), and tech enthusiasts (.foo, .zip, .mov, and .nexus), but at least two of those present a
        significant cybersecurity risk, experts have warned1.</p>
    <p>The TLDs in question - .zip and .mov - share their name with common file formats (ZIP archives and video files)
        that exist outside of the Internet’s four walls, which many cybersecurity experts are calling out for being
        misleading1.</p>
    <p>While other similarly vulnerable TLDs have been rolled out in the past, such as .docs, the introduction of two
        more increase the chances of a scam or phishing attack, giving threat actors more routes1.</p>
    <h2>.zip and .mov TLD risk</h2>
    <p>A legitimate website with any TLD, including ‘dangerous’ examples like .zip, could include a help section
        describing the process required to open a zipped file, for example. Should that file be named - in our case,
        example.zip - a user’s browser may then automatically add a hyperlink because it knows that .zip is a legitimate
        TLD, even though in our case the page refers to a local file and not a website1.</p>
    <p>While the file itself is safe, a threat actor could have already registered a website under that domain in the
        hope that unsuspecting users click on hyperlinks that lead them to a malicious page that could be the host to
        malware, phishing attacks, or other scams1.</p>
    <p>Already, a series of concerning domains have been registered under the new and risky TLDs in the hope that
        someone, somewhere, has referred to the file name on a web page, which will then be converted to a hyperlink to
        their malicious site1.</p>
    <h2>Examples of phishing attacks using .zip domains</h2>
    <p>According to the SANS Internet Storm Center, about 1230 names have been registered so far under the .zip TLD. The
        top level domain was approved in 2014 but it took Google until May 2023 to unlock it for public registration
        alongside seven other domain extensions2.</p>
    <p>The .zip extension allows cyber criminals to run phishing campaigns that abuse the fact that .zip is a popular
        file extension and also a top level domain. Domains such as officeupdate.zip or microsoft-office.zip have
        already been used in phishing campaigns2. The latter is still online but safe browsing should warn users prior
        to accessing the site in question2.</p>
    <p>Several of the registered domains could be used in phishing campaigns, while others may be used for legitimate
        purposes. The makers of archiving software might register a matching domain name for their products2. Most of
        the registered domains have not been set up to display web content. The message "the site can’t be reached" or
        similar messages are displayed in this case2.</p>
    <h2>How to protect yourself from .zip domain phishing attacks</h2>
    <p>While there are some steps that a user can take to be more savvy when it comes to following potentially risky
        links, some of the responsibility must ultimately fall with Google. The company did not immediately respond to
        TechRadar Pro ’s request for comment1.</p>
    <p>Some of the steps that users can take are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Be careful when clicking on links that end with .zip or .mov, especially if they are sent via email or
            social media messages. Verify the sender and the context before opening any link.</li>
        <li>Use a browser that supports safe browsing features and warns you about malicious sites. You can also use
            extensions or tools that block phishing sites or check the reputation of domains.</li>
        <li>Avoid downloading or opening any files from unknown or suspicious sources. Scan any files with antivirus
            software before opening them.</li>
        <li>Educate yourself and others about the cybersecurity risks of new TLDs and how to spot phishing attempts.
        </li>
        <li>Report any suspicious or malicious domains to Google or other authorities.</li>
    </ul>
